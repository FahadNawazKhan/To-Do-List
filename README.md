**🚀 Project Overview**  
This project features a basic To-Do List application developed using Tkinter, which is Python's built-in library for creating graphical user interfaces. It enables users to effortlessly add, view, and remove tasks.

**✨ Key Features**  
- **Add Task:** Users can type their tasks into a text box and submit them by pressing the "Add" button, which adds the tasks to the visible list.
- **Delete Task:** Users can choose a task from the list and hit the "Delete" button to eliminate it from the list.
- **Persistent Storage:** The application stores the tasks in a text file named `data.txt`, ensuring that the list of tasks is preserved even after the application is closed.

**⚙️ How to Operate**  
- Start by executing the `todo.py` script.
- To add a task, type it into the text box and click the "Add" button.
- To delete a task, select it from the list and click the "Delete" button.
- The list of tasks is automatically saved to `data.txt` and is reloaded each time the application is launched.

**🛠️ Project Structure**  
- `todo.py`: Contains the source code of the To-Do List application.
- `data.txt`: Serves as the storage file for tasks.
- `README.md`: Offers a detailed explanation of the project and user instructions.

**📋 How to Use**  
- Execute the `todo.py` script with Python to run the application.
